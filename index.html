    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hello! This is my personal website. I am a graduated student of the coding boot camp put on by theClubhou.se in Augusta, Georgia. My goal is to become a front-end web developer. The course covers HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL, as well as NodeJS and Express. I am beyond excited to start a new career in web development!</p>
    <br>
    <p>I also have several hobbies. I love to paint, and I created the art at the top of this page. I also play the trumpet! I played for 6 years before taking a break and recently picked it back up. I'm still rusty but with enough practice I hope to get to my previous skill level. Playing an instrument is also an amazing and fun way to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6368928/" alt="Study about benefits of playing an instrument."> improve communication skills and promote cognitive functions,</a> which are skills applicable to all aspects of daily life (including coding!).</p>
